# About
Mikeno is a fork of OpenFOAM, it's Frankensteined for chemical engineering usage.

[简体中文](README.md) [English]

## Goal of this fork
1. Better support for modeling chemical engineering process. 
2. Continually merge upstream updates
3. Build system migration: Replace wmake with CMake.
4. Fix unexpected SIGFPE trapping, mainly for double-precision. 
   - Compiler optimizes float-point computation with SIMD, but they generates unexpected NAN sometimes. These NAN are never used, but emits SIGFPE

## Modifications

### New Utilities
1. `autoCompress`: Compress all heavy fields (non-uniform, including mesh) to gzip, regardless of format(ascii or binary)

### Code and compiler
1. Migrated all subprojects from wmake to modern cmake.
   - Compatible to modern IDEs, high-quality linting from clangd
   - More convenient to import external dependencies
   - More efficient parallel build
   - More convenient for secondary development with `find_package(OpenFOAM CONFIG)`
2. Performance optimization
   - Add `-march=native` for optimization mode, enabling more vectorization from compiler
3. Support `AOCC`.
4. Remove redundant reference in solver modules.
   1. Currently cleand `isothermalFluidSolver` `fluidSolver` `multicomponentFluidSolver` `XiFluidSolver`

### Support arbitrarily high pressure
1. The `pOffset` keyword can be added to `physicalProperites`, allowing gauge pressure for p-V coupling, and absolute pressure for thermophysical. **Small pressure difference will never be flooded by floating point rounding error(espicially single precision)**.

### Porous media heat transfer
1. `porousMediaFluidSolver` supporting arbitrary number of porous phases, heat transfer between fluid-porous and porous-porous, both supporting thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium.

### More rigours thermodynamics
1. Equation of state: add `RedlichKwongGas`, rewrite `PengRobinsonGas`
2. Both real gas EOSs are tested with AspenPlusV14
3. Van der vaals mixing rule.
   - Support binary interaction coefficient `k_ij` for `PengRobinsonGas`
4. All thermo models (eq `hConst`) supports `ideal_*` methods that gives ideal gas properties.
5. New mixture model `realGasMulticomponentMixture` 
   1. Compute `rho` from mixed real gas EOS
   2. Compute and add residual properties of `Cp` `Cv` `hs` `ha` `es` `ea`. All residual properties are computed from mixed EOS
   3. Apply harmonic mass weighed mixing for density (no extra volume)
   4. Appy mass weighed mixing for he and Cp Cv (no extra energy)
   5. Arrhenius mixing for mu
   6. Vredeveled mixing for kappa (n=-2)
6. Add `phase` keyword to `equationOfState` dictionary, allow using real fluid EOS for liquid.

## Fix unexpected SIGFPE trapping (compile option in brackes)
1. Fix `flowRateInletVelocity` trapped by SIGFPE when writting flow field. This is caused by division in `unitConversion::toUser(const T& t) const`. (`Clang DP Opt`)
2. Fix `chemistryModel` trapped by SIGFPE when calculating reaction rate. This is is trapped in `Foam::Reaction<ThermoType>::C`, probably caused by branching logic. (`Clang DP Release`)
3. Fix unexpected SIGFPE globally by adding `-ffp-exception-behavior=maytrap`. (`Clang`)


## Pending works
1. More equation of state: Patel-Teja, Martin-Hou
2. Extend porous media heat trSolveransfer to multicomponent
3. Stabilize `porousMediaFluid` for non-equilibrium heat transfer with large coefficient or specific area


## Existing Bugs(Up to 20251224):
1. `decomposePar` crashes with Largrangian fields(Some cases in `test/Largrangian` fail)
2. Some postprocessing fails (`test/postProcessing/channel`)
